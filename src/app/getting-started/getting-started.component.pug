        h1 Getting started
        p.lead Welcome to Slamby. Congratulation, you made the very first step to work with our awesome products. You are almost done, but before getting started working with your Slamby product, here are a few useful information.
        h2 API install
        p You can use your Slamby API as a SaaS, or you can download, and host is by yourself. When you want to host it by yourself, the first thing you need to manage is the installation. To install Slamby API, please check the product readme and the installation guide.
        p Product documentation: #[a(href="https://github.com/slamby/slamby-api" target="_blank") https://github.com/slamby/slamby-api]
        p Using Docker Compose, here are the installation steps:
        ol
            li Install Docker on your machine: #[a( href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation" target="") Official Docker installation guide]  
            li Install Docker Compose on your machine (minimum 1.9.0 required): #[a( href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install" target="_blank") Official Docker Compose installation guide]
            li Download our Docker Compose file<br>
                code $ curl -L "https://github.com/slamby/slamby-api/releases/download/v1.2.0/docker-compose.yml" > docker-compose.yml 
            li Compose the containers (run next to the compose file)<br>
                pre $ docker-compose up -d 
            li Your server is installed. Check that if it's working correctly 
         
        h2 API activation
        p Open your Slamby API server at http://api_url/setup.
        p Great, you have an installed Slamby API. Now your first step is the activation process.<br>
            | During the setup process you need to:
        ul
            li Request a Slamby License, 
            li Copy your Slamby API License, 
            li and set the secret (password) for your Slamby API. 
            li Continue with the API activation.
        p License
        p For open-source projects, you can use an open-source license for free, or for commercial purpose you can use a commercial license.
        p For open-source license, you can request one from the setup wizard directly by typing your e-mail address and click the Request a License button. Our license service will generate an open-sourced license for you and will send it via email to the given email address.
        p When your product or company is not open-sourced you cannot use Slamby API with open-source license; you need to purchase a commercial license. The pricing is based on the processor core number.
        p For pricing details, please check our pricing #[a( href="https://www.slamby.com/pricing") https://www.slamby.com/pricing]
